Litter is a simple cat-themed parody of Twitter to demonstrate my coding ability.

The goal of Litter was to create a fully functional web appellation without the use of any libraries or frameworks. It's just pure and basic PHP and JavaScript here.

The code is open sourced for demonstration purposes only. Please download, play around, and make suggestions to me if you'd like, but I am not looking for anyone else to contribute to the code.

And of course, please hire me for a job if you like what you see. :-)
